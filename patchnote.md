# AnkiStreak Version 0.3 (Tuxemons)

## New Features

- You now have 3 tuxemons in your tuxemon inventory. You can open the tuxemon inventory by clicking on the tuxemon
  button in the top right corner of the screen.
- You can feed each tuxemon with a fruit of its type. You can feed a tuxemon by clicking on the tuxemon and selecting
  the feed option.
- Tuxemons have as of now only a xp bar. Later we can add useful stats for the Tuxemon game like attack, defense, etc.
  Which will increase its xp
- Overall UI improvements. Very cool acrylic background for the inventory and tuxemon menu. That took me 2hours to
  create :D

## Ideas for improving the tuxemon system

- Add more tuxemons, add more stats, display tuxemon names

## Known Bugs

- Performance decrease when selecting a farming tool will be fixed in the next version.
